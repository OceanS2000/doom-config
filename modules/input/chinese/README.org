* Description
This module adds support for Chinese input support by ~pyim~.

** Module Flags
+ =+childframe= Use ~posframe~ package for input method.
+ =+rime= Use ~emacs-rime~ instead of ~pyim~ (not implemented)

** Plugins
+ [[https://github.com/tumashu/pyim][pyim]] (unless =+rime=)
+ [[https://github.com/DogLooksGood/emacs-rime/][emacs-rime]] (when =+rime=)

** Hacks
+ ~org-html-paragraph~ has been modified to join consecutive Chinese lines into
  a single long line without wanted spaced (when exporting org-mode to html).
+ The double pinyin input method is embedded.

* Prerequisites
** Rime
When used with =+rime= support, ~librime~ library is needed. See [[https://github.com/DogLooksGood/emacs-rime/][README.md]] of
~emacs-rime~ for details.

* Features
This module adds support for Chinese input support by ~pyim~.

* Configuration
For me it works out of box. No specific configuration options expect for those
provided by the package is included.

* Troubleshooting
Maybe [[https://github.com/cnsunyour/.doom.d/tree/develop/modules/cnsunyour/chinese][this chinese module]] can be used as reference
